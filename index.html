                        Welcome to my satellite! Make yourself at home! I'm Asta, also known as OctoRocket or XTeamXeno
                        depending on which account you are looking at. I'm still working on this website, as is
                        blatantly
                        obvious. Hope to see you around soon!

                        His website is the reason that I decided to make this website in the reason I decided to make
                        this
                        website in the first place! If you're reading this, thanks for the inspiration!

                        You carefully align your ship next to the satellite. Without a word from the satellite, it

                        blindingly thick swarm of nanodrones which immediately surround your >ship. You hear your ship's
                        hull
                        groan as it is forcefully welded to the satellite. Your hear a hole being bored into the side of
                        your
                        ship. Before you can turn your head to look at the damage, air from the satellite is already
                        rushing
                        in. It looks homely... someone used to live here. You hear... footsteps? Maybe someone still
                        does...

                        Now, how about I (almost) properly introduce myself! I'm Asta, a |-| year old &gt;=|=&lt; who enjoys
                        programming,
                        video gaming (of most genres!), listening to music (of just as many genres) (when I remember
                        to),
                        fucking up my computer to horrific degrees, and talking to people! I suppose I also like using
                        way too
                        many parentheses too! I use :3 and -w-, if that scares you than uhhh- suck it I guess :3
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a large proponent of free (libre) and open source software. I use Linux (NixOS) as my
                        operating system of choice and love this OS to death (probably unhealthily at this point). I 
                        both feel self conscious about seeming to know a lot about computers and also like to brag about
                        it. I measure the amount I know by looking at the amount I don't know, which happens to be a 
                        lot. Maybe that isn't the best idea when it comes to self esteem. /shrug
