                Reading back through my old blog posts, jeez was I losing it. I
                have great news though, I am out of school for the summer! This
                means I'll (most likely) be back working on this site more
                frequently! I really want it to be something that isn't just a
                testiment to how depressed I was, so I've gotta come up with
                something interesting to put here! If anyone has any ideas I'm
                open to suggestions, but for now I'll probably just try to make
                it look a bit better. Thanks for reading, that's all for now
                folks! -Asta

                Well, as I assume you can tell from my last post, January wasn't
                the best for my mental health. All it took was one warm day and
                a trip outside for that to change really quick. Unfortunately,
                the curse of the midwest has fallen and it's cold again, but my
                mood isn't where it used to be, which is definitely an
                improvement!<br>
                I've been hooked on looking at stuff in nature. Specifically,
                I'm finding rocks and minerals quite interesting, as well as
                plants and trees. The trees have even started to bud here,
                though the sudden dip into the 20s might kill of all the buds. I
                have my figures crossed that they stay alive though! I don't
                know the last time I was so interested in the world around me,
                and it makes me really happy to just enjoy nature.<br>
                More development soon? You'll just have to find out! -Asta

                Another blog post starting with me apologizing. I guess I should
                start with the story. It's still floating around in my head, and
                I know what I'm gonna write next, but I just haven't felt the
                urge to actually type anything. I haven't been able to keep one
                project in my mind long enough to work on it. All my motivation
                is coming in infrequent bursts, not enough to do anything
                meaningful with. <br>
                I should note that I'm writing this exactly 3 hours after the
                last of the sunlight passed over the horizon, so I'm not exactly
                in the best mental state. Reguardless, I still feel empty. I
                don't know if it is because I haven't been doing much, I haven't
                ever been doing much, because I feel more lonely than I've ever
                been while surrounded by people that feel so distant. I just
                don't know why I feel like this. I wish I could keep working on
                things like this site, and I won't say that I'm not going to.
                I'm just going to say that the updates will be infrequent, more
                than infrequent, and possibly absent. If you want to contact me,
                do so, I'll probably be there to listen to you. I'm sorry for
                being so <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">I'M NOT EVEN

                Sorry I haven't been working on this story much. I have some of
                the ideas I need --- in fact I have most of them --- but putting
                them down on a page is actually really hard! I swear I don't
                just suck at this!

                For real though, I am in fact working on this stuff, just taking

                You may have noticed how that last post there wasn't actually
                blog material but story content??? Well uh... yeah... I got
                bored and wanted to put something on my blog so I drew a little
                image made a little story and posted it on da internets and all
                that jazz. It's loosely connected to the actually main story I'm
                working on (<a href="./untitled-1/index.html">this one</a>) so
                y'know... Oh and by loosely I mean the two characters said
                similar words and I didn't want to have TWO files quoting the
                same few lines of that one Mac DeMarco song. The song more
                relates to my actual story, but that character I have yet to
                name can share with the man-amongst-monsters or whatever from
                that last blog post.

                    Sometimes I get bored. This creature (or at least a
                    simplified variation of it) appears on each page of my
                    notebook. It seems to be waiting for someone to walk through
                    it. I would. <br> I feel like being physically uncomfortable
                    is a good state to be in. If it ends up that you're safe,
                    then you eventually can find comfort in the uncomfortable.
                    If it turns out not to be, well, you know that you have a
                    right to be afraid. This won't hurt you, but it'll keep you
                    out from whatever's behind it. Just be glad it can't move, I
                    suppose. Its brother, an ambush predator, can. Maybe one day
                    a depiction of him will be drawn. Don't hold me to it,
                    looking at that thing scares me a little. I kind of wish I
                    didn't live where I do. I like being able to look stuff up
                    and be able to find out information on things; you can't
                    really do that when you're the only one who knows of these
                    things' existance. <br> I don't know exactly where I am, but
                    <a href="./untitled-1/alone.txt">&lt;--| CUT |--&gt;</a>
                    <br>. The lack of period there was unsatifying, so I fixed
                    it. I'm not quite sure what the last guy was saying, but the
                    call-in ended there. I've heard from him a few times now,
                    but he isn't taking calls so, I can't answer any of your (or
                    my) questions. Let's just hope he's alright. That's all we
                    can do.

                I accidently completely and utterly screwed up the site, someone remind me how to program well... (I put
                the right column in the left column somehow while trying to clean up the source code.) This has happened
                many times before but uhhhhh... I didn't have a blog to mald over it on. Fortunately, now I can! Mald,

                Yes yes, I know these seem horrifically concerning, but all of
                bad stuff is text I came up with when I was tired and trying to
                seem interesting. I'm doing okay now, therapy and
                antidepressants do wonders. But actually, please don't worry
                about me, I'm doing a lot better.

                Distracted by games and life and many other things. I'll get
                back to this website soon, I promise!<br>
                I'm actually okay. I should stop writing stuff on this website
                when I'm extremely tired and trying to be edgy(? or maybe just
                dramatic, I'm not quite sure anymore.)<br>
                For every step I take forward, at least a few punishments must
                be forced. <br>
                I'm rapidly oscillating between being reasonable happy and being
                prepared to eviscerate myself completely and wholly. I know
                there isn't a revival, but do I? After all, I've done it at
                least once before...<br>
