                    Sometimes I get bored. This creature (or at least a
                    simplified variation of it) appears on each page of my
                    notebook. It seems to be waiting for someone to walk through
                    it. I would. <br> I feel like being physically uncomfortable
                    is a good state to be in. If it ends up that you're safe,
                    then you eventually can find comfort in the uncomfortable.
                    If it turns out not to be, well, you know that you have a
                    right to be afraid. This won't hurt you, but it'll keep you
                    out from whatever's behind it. Just be glad it can't move, I
                    suppose. Its brother, an ambush predator, can. Maybe one day
                    a depiction of him will be drawn. Don't hold me to it,
                    looking at that thing scares me a little. I kind of wish I
                    didn't live where I do. I like being able to look stuff up
                    and be able to find out information on things; you can't
                    really do that when you're the only one who knows of these
                    things' existance. <br> I don't know exactly where I am, but
                    <a href="./untitled-1/alone.txt">&lt;--| CUT |--&gt;</a>
                    <br>. The lack of period there was unsatifying, so I fixed
                    it. I'm not quite sure what the last guy was saying, but the
                    call-in ended there. I've heard from him a few times now,
                    but he isn't taking calls so, I can't answer any of your (or
                    my) questions. Let's just hope he's alright. That's all we
                    can do.

                I accidently completely and utterly screwed up the site, someone remind me how to program well... (I put
                the right column in the left column somehow while trying to clean up the source code.) This has happened
                many times before but uhhhhh... I didn't have a blog to mald over it on. Fortunately, now I can! Mald,
                that is.

                I'm a rehashed product made as a quick cash grab by a company
                that went out of business a month after making me. <br>
                nothing matters but everything matters but [continued] <br>
