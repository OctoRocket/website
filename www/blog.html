                I accidently completely and utterly screwed up the site, someone remind me how to program well... (I put
                the right column in the left column somehow while trying to clean up the source code.) This has happened
                many times before but uhhhhh... I didn't have a blog to mald over it on. Fortunately, now I can! Mald,
                that is.
