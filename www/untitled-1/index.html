            "So... I do have to ask you... where'd you find this piece of
            junk?" <em>A portly man, advanced in age, sits at the front counter
            of a dimly lit repair bay. He chuckles to himself gently.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, it seems like this unit just... gave in. It was just laying
            face down in the middle of the charging bay that's currently being
            rebuilt, the one the west side. Quite an eerie sight really..." <em>
            A nervous looking man stands across the counter. He is wearing a
            reflective orange vest with a patch labeling him as an
            "NCRS<sup>1</sup> Worker."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The portly man shifts his glasses. A name tag reads "Jonas
            Bierfelt."</em> "Do you think..?" <em>He looks nervously at the
            worker. The worker gives a reassuring reply.</em> "No. It was a
            GA<sup>2</sup> who reported spotting it. I'd hope they'd check if it
            was Cavaric<sup>3</sup>, but who knows... I'd expect another GA at
            your door soon anyhows. It doesn't look like any model of anything
            --- sapient or otherwise mind you --- I've seen working on
            this station." <em>The worker takes a second, thinking.</em> "And
            from working over at Evanesce..." <em>He continues, stalling for
            time as he lets his brain work.</em> "No, I don't think I've seen
            anything like this at all."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>He peers back into the repair bay; his eyelids squeeze as
            they try to make out the figure laying uncomfortably on the floor.
            His face strains as he's taken aback by its twitching.</em> "I'm not
            sure why... but don't you feel like there's something wrong with it?
            It's like seeing a rabid<sup>4</sup> animal... so helpless lying
            there on the floor..." <em>The man's face is full of pity, something
            that causes the repair worker to swivel his chair to face the unit.
            His face doesn't match that of the worker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well yeah something's wrong with it, there's something wrong with
            everything you bring in," <em>he remarks in a lighthearted tone. His
            eyes study the twitching figure for a moment more.</em> "But I do
            agree, something is definitely different about it... Maybe it's just
            the missing model information that has me..." <em>He knows this not
            to be the case, there's something deeper, more primal at the heart
            of his concerns. It's a feeling almost maternal.</em> "I'll see what
            I can do." <em>He speaks now in a reserved tone, though he's halfway
            to getting off his chair when he remembers he must address his
            client. He turns slowly.</em> "I'd figure it's some sort of rehashed
            product." <em>He says this despite not recognizing a single element
            of the design. He continues,</em> "made as a quick cash grab by a
            company that went out of business a month after making it." <em>A
            soft hum of a fan system starts up, then sputters to a stop. This
            display of conciousness is interposed by a weak beep. Neither of the
            men notice.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The worker nods, finally looking away from the spasming device.
            </em> "As always," <em>he remarks, trying to lighten the tone,</em>
            "I hope I don't have to see you again, but by now you know that I'll
            be around the tavern for drinks. Hope I haven't bothered you too
            much this thursday<sup>5</sup>!" <em>He chuckles slightly, but can't
            shake the unnerving feeling of the clinking in the darkened bay.
            </em> "Ah, well you've certainly given me some work. I might be a
            bit late to the tavern. This thing's just too intriguing to me..."
            <em>He thinks for a moment, accidentally allowing the worker to stew
            in his nerves a bit longer.</em> "Ah, sorry, see you soon yeah?"
            <em>The worker nods.</em> "Sure thing, see ya Jonas." <em>Jonas does
            not return the farewell as the worker walks off, possibly content
            with his goodbye already, but more possibly interested more in the
            alien object now in his possession more than the tavern or the
            worker.</em>

        <em>A figure sits quietly in a perfectly white environment on its knees.
        Its head is spherical with large, round, black eyes that watch the
        floor. Though lacking a mouth, it looks in thought. It wears a cloth
        veil over its body, obsuring everything but the round legs it kneels
        upon. It is a pale green in color, in contrast to that of the figure
        floating in the corner --- its business does not need expounding upon
        --- which is a pale purple. They also differ on the horns on their head.
        The pale purple figure features very long, gently curved, jet black
        horns. The pale green figure's jet black horns are shorter, curving into
        a loop and sticking out straight forwards, in a simular manner to the
        horns of a ram. The pale purple figure turns to its sister, yet it
        doesn't find her.</em>

        <em>A limp, pale green figure tumbles through a dark, dimly lit

        undergo stresses of any kind, it shatters immedietly. The horns slither,
        shrinking down into a dark, shelless mollusk. It bounces off one of the

        <p><em>The mollusk feels its surroundings. This tech is unfamiliar to
        it, and it will get no use out of the machine by staring really hard at
        it. It interfaces with what it believes is the man storage drive and
        transfers what it has recieved to it. After fiddling with the file
        system for what it would consider an embarrassing amount of time, the
        mollusk finds that the data fits handly on the drive. At this point it
        admits to itself that it can get no further with the device off. Before
        it can attempt to start up the machine, it feels motion. The device is
        being moved. It is not in a state it escape, and so it trusts that this
        movement will lead to a safer location. The idea that the unit it
        currently is taking residence in may be destroyed does gain some weight
        in the mind mollusk's mind. It analyzes some options for dealing with
        this possiblity and stores them in a physical secretion and leaves the
        resulting orb off to the side, storing it safely within the robot for
        now, along side the transmission.</em></p>
        <p><em>Once it feels that it stopped moving, the parasite begins
        analyzing its host. It connects the terminals of its power source and
        finds it long dead; the source has developed scale covering a caustic
        acid leak. It recoils slightly from the burning sensation it induces.
        Contacting the negative terminal with the corroded, conductive assembly
        it once was hardwired to causes the robot to jerk, throwing the mollusk
        against the outside wall. It can make use of this.</em></p>
        <p><em>It stretches out along the body, interfacing now with a ring of
        cameras mounted upon the head of the robot. Four eyes are mounted on the
        ring, clustered in pairs of two, but only one eye out of the four seems
        to activate when the mollusk again connects the negative terminal to the
        bus. The two eye clusters are meant to swivel around the ring, but at
        the moment gravity is the only force able to move them. It adds this
        information to the orb dedicated to this unit's design. Both clusters
        are facing towards a figure infront of some light. Another jerk of the
        robot reveals the figure's appearance and the presence of a second
        figure behind a counter. It continues to twitch, trying to reveal more
        about its surroundings. Machines surround it. Light is scarce. The two
        figures are communcating. The pearl dedicated to this interaction grows
        to the size of a small gravel.</em></p>

        <p>The commotion after Viridian's puppet disappeared was quite intense.
        Due to the intense emotional distress, the auxiliary subsystems ---
        those which are not Subsystem 1, name "Indigo" --- lost contact with
        Subsystem 1. Resynchronization subsequent to the event revealed that
        Indigo was using practically all of her computational capacity to
        compute a select few things, but most of the energy from the dramatic
        spike in power utilization was going towards figuring out how to comfort
        Viridian. About 8820 thoughts were transmitted between Indigo and
        Viridian's tower within the few tenths of a second that the auxiliary
        subsystems lost contact with Indigo.</p>
        <p>While this was happening, the 7 rationality processors (subsystems
        2-8) had noted the ALFO Low Wave Detection Array's sudden spike in
        activity and deduced that the puppet had most likely traveled across the
        plane. This deduction lead to a flurry of activity at ALFO. The result
        is pronounced in great detail in <a href="./index.html">this document
        </a>.</p>
        <p>Workers were alarmed by the power spike (about a 5 times increase in
        power going towards tower 1 (Ascentsion) and about a 7 times increase in
        power going to Viridian's tower (The First Decent)), but the main
        capacitor array was able to deal with the load handily.</p>
