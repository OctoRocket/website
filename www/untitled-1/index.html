            "So... I do have to ask you... where'd you find this piece of
            junk?" <em>A portly man sits at the front counter of a dimly lit
            repair bay. He chuckles to himself gently. He seems advanced in
            age.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, it seems like this unit just... gave up. Either that or
            there was something very wrong it's interface because it was
            just in the middle of the charging bay that's currently being
            rebuilt, the one the west side. Quite an eerie sight really..." <em>
            A nervous looking man stands across the counter. He is wearing a
            reflective orange vest with a patch labeling him as an
            "NCRS<sup>1</sup> Worker."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The portly man shifts his glasses. A name tag reads "Jonas
            Bierfelt."</em> "Do you think..?" <em>He looks nervously at the
            worker. The worker gives a reassuring reply.</em> "No. It was an
            GA<sup>2</sup> who reported spotting it. I'd hope they'd check if it
            was Cavaric<sup>3</sup>, but who knows... I'd expect another GA at
            your door soon anyhows. It doesn't look like any model of anything
            &ndash sapient or otherwise mind you &ndash I've seen working on
            this station." <em>The worker takes a second, thinking.</em> "And
            from working over at Evanesce..." <em>He continues, stalling for
            time as he lets his brain work.</em> "No, I don't think I've seen
            anything like this at all."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>He peers back into the repair bay; his eyelids squeeze as
            they try to make out the figure laying uncomfortably on the floor.
            His face strains as he's taken aback by its twitching.</em> "I'm not
            sure why... but don't you feel like there's something wrong with it?
            It's like seeing a rabid<sup>4</sup> animal... so helpless lying
            there on the floor..." <em>The man's face is full of pity, something
            that causes the repair worker to swivel his chair to face the unit.
            His face doesn't match that of the worker.</em>

            <li>At the time of this writing, Lymir station was at war with
            Cavaric station. They are on the seperate ends of the solar system,
            with no practical way of attacking each other. This, of course, was
            well known. The war played out more like a game; raids, shootings,
            and bombings were carried out but no casualties occured. A study
            from the time took survey of the soldiers after the war had
            concluded and noted "not a single solider on either side had taken
            on an injury that left permanent damage."</li>

            effects as rabies, and as such been translated as such.</li>
