            "So... I do have to ask you... where'd you find this piece of
            junk?" <em>A portly man, advanced in age, sits at the front counter
            of a dimly lit repair bay. He chuckles to himself gently.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, it seems like this unit just... gave in. It was just laying
            face down in the middle of the charging bay that's currently being
            rebuilt, the one the west side. Quite an eerie sight really..." <em>
            A nervous looking man stands across the counter. He is wearing a
            reflective orange vest with a patch labeling him as an
            "NCRS<sup>1</sup> Worker."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The portly man shifts his glasses. A name tag reads "Jonas
            Bierfelt."</em> "Do you think..?" <em>He looks nervously at the
            worker. The worker gives a reassuring reply.</em> "No. It was a
            GA<sup>2</sup> who reported spotting it. I'd hope they'd check if it
            was Cavaric<sup>3</sup>, but who knows... I'd expect another GA at
            your door soon anyhows. It doesn't look like any model of anything
            --- sapient or otherwise mind you --- I've seen working on
            this station." <em>The worker takes a second, thinking.</em> "And
            from working over at Evanesce..." <em>He continues, stalling for
            time as he lets his brain work.</em> "No, I don't think I've seen
            anything like this at all."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>He peers back into the repair bay; his eyelids squeeze as
            they try to make out the figure laying uncomfortably on the floor.
            His face strains as he's taken aback by its twitching.</em> "I'm not
            sure why... but don't you feel like there's something wrong with it?
            It's like seeing a rabid<sup>4</sup> animal... so helpless lying
            there on the floor..." <em>The man's face is full of pity, something
            that causes the repair worker to swivel his chair to face the unit.
            His face doesn't match that of the worker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well yeah something's wrong with it, there's something wrong with
            everything you bring in," <em>he remarks in a lighthearted tone. His
            eyes study the twitching figure for a moment more.</em> "But I do
            agree, something is definitely different about it... Maybe it's just
            the missing model information that has me..." <em>He knows this not
            to be the case, there's something deeper, more primal at the heart
            of his concerns. It's a feeling almost maternal.</em> "I'll see what
            I can do." <em>He speaks now in a reserved tone, though he's halfway
            to getting off his chair when he remembers he must address his
            client. He turns slowly.</em> "I'd figure it's some sort of rehashed
            product." <em>He says this despite not recognizing a single element
            of the design. He continues,</em> "made as a quick cash grab by a
            company that went out of business a month after making it." <em>A
            soft hum of a fan system starts up, then sputters to a stop. This
            display of conciousness is interposed by a weak beep. Neither of the
            men notice.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The worker nods, finally looking away from the spasming device.
            </em> "As always," <em>he remarks, trying to lighten the tone,</em>
            "I hope I don't have to see you again, but by now you know that I'll
            be around the tavern for drinks. Hope I haven't bothered you too
            much this thursday<sup>5</sup>!" <em>He chuckles slightly, but can't
            shake the unnerving feeling of the clinking in the darkened bay.
            </em> "Ah, well you've certainly given me some work. I might be a
            bit late to the tavern. This thing's just too intriguing to me..."
            <em>He thinks for a moment, accidentally allowing the worker to stew
            in his nerves a bit longer.</em> "Ah, sorry, see you soon yeah?"
            <em>The worker nods.</em> "Sure thing, see ya Jonas." <em>Jonas does
            not return the farewell as the worker walks off, possibly content
            with his goodbye already, but more possibly interested more in the
            alien object now in his possession more than the tavern or the
            worker.</em>

        <em>A figure sits quietly in a perfectly white environment on its knees.
        Its head is spherical with large, round, black eyes that watch the
        floor. Though lacking a mouth, it looks in thought. It wears a cloth
        veil over its body, obsuring everything but the round legs it kneels
        upon. It is a pale green in color, in contrast to that of the figure
        floating in the corner --- its business does not need expounding upon
        --- which is a pale purple. They also differ on the horns on their head.
        The pale purple figure features very long, gently curved, jet black
        horns. The pale green figure's jet black horns are shorter, curving into
        a loop and sticking out straight forwards, in a simular manner to the
        horns of a ram. The pale purple figure turns to its sister, yet it
        doesn't find her.</em>

        <em>A limp, pale green figure tumbles through a dark, dimly lit
        warehouse. The body smashes through a rack of automatons. Not meant to
        undergo stresses of any kind, it shatters immedietly. The horns slither,
        shrinking down into a dark, shelless mollusk. It bounces off one of the
        robots but latches on to another, burying into the side.</em>

        <em>An android with miniscule hole in the side of its chest crashes down
        into a nonfunctional charging bay. Its antennas fire up sporadically,

        the mollusk only recieves a segment of it. It will have to make do.</em>
