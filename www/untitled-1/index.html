            <em>A portly man, advanced in age, sits at the front counter of a
            dimly lit repair bay. He chuckles to himself gently.</em> "So... I
            do have to ask you... where'd you find this piece of junk?"
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, it seems like this unit just... gave up. It was just laying
            face down in the middle of the charging bay that's currently being
            rebuilt, the one on the west side. Quite an eerie sight really..."
            </p>
        <p>
            <em>A nervous looking man stands across the counter. He is wearing a
            reflective orange vest with a patch labeling him as an
            "NCRS<sup>1</sup> Worker."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The portly man shifts his glasses. A name tag reads "Jonas
            Bierfelt."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Do you think..?" <em>He looks nervously at the
            worker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "No. It was a GA<sup>2</sup> who reported spotting it.
            I'd hope they'd check if it was Cavaric<sup>3</sup>, but who
            knows... I'd expect another GA at your door soon anyhows. It doesn't
            look like any model of anything I've seen working on this station,
            sapient or otherwise."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The worker takes a second, thinking.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "And from working over at Evanesce..." <em>he continues, stalling
            for time as he lets his brain work.</em> "No, I don't think I've
            seen anything like this at all."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>He peers back into the repair bay; his eyelids squeeze as
            they try to make out the figure laying uncomfortably on the floor.
            His face strains as he's taken aback by its twitching.</em>
            </p>
        <p>
            "I'm not sure why... but don't you feel like there's something wrong
            with it? It's like seeing a rabid<sup>4</sup> animal... so helpless
            lying there on the floor..."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The man's face is full of pity, something that causes the repair
            worker to swivel his chair to face the unit. His face doesn't match
            that of the worker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well yeah something's wrong with it, there's something wrong with
            everything you bring in," <em>he remarks in a lighthearted tone. His
            eyes study the twitching figure for a moment more.</em> "But I do
            agree, something is definitely different about it... Maybe it's just
            the missing model information that has me..." <em>He knows this not
            to be the case, there's something deeper, more primal at the heart
            of his concerns. It's a feeling almost maternal.</em> "I'll see what
            I can do." <em>He speaks now in a reserved tone, though he's halfway
            to getting off his chair when he remembers his client is still
            waiting. He turns slowly.</em> "I'd figure it's some sort of
            rehashed product." <em>He says this despite not recognizing a single
            element of the design. He continues,</em> "made as a quick cash grab
            by a company that went out of business a month after making it."
            <em>A reasonable guess, yet the design remains so alien compared
            with anything the repairman has worked on before.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>A soft hum of a fan system starts up, then sputters to a stop.
            This display of consciousness ends with a weak beep. Neither of the
            men notice.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The worker nods, finally looking away from the spasming device.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "As always," <em>he remarks, trying to lighten the tone,</em>
            "I hope I don't have to see you again, but by now you know that I'll
            be around the tavern for drinks. Hope I haven't bothered you too
            much!"
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The repairman chuckles slightly, but can't shake the unnerving
            feeling of the clinking in the darkened bay. </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ah, well you've certainly given me some work. I might be a bit late
            to the tavern. This thing's just too intriguing to me..."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>He thinks for a moment, accidentally allowing the worker to stew
            in his nerves a bit longer.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Ah, sorry, see you soon yeah?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The worker nods.</em> "Sure thing, see ya Jonas."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Jonas does not return the farewell as the worker walks off,
            already invested more in the alien object now in his possession more
            than the tavern or the worker.</em>

        upon. It is a pale green in color, in contrast to that of the figure
        floating in the corner --- its business does not need expounding upon
        --- which is a pale purple. They also differ on the horns on their head.
        The pale purple figure features very long, gently curved, jet black
        horns. The pale green figure's jet black horns are shorter, curving into
        a loop and sticking out straight forwards, in a simular manner to the
        horns of a ram. The pale purple figure turns to its sister, yet it

        <p><em>The mollusk feels its surroundings. This tech is unfamiliar to
        it. Passive observation will not give the body any use, at least not in
        a timely manner, so it decides to probe deeper. It interfaces with what
        it believes is the main storage drive, and after fiddling with the file
        system for what it would consider an embarrassing amount of time (if it
        could experience such emotions), the mollusk finds little use in the
        drive. It seems that it only has fragments of data. Its local logs are
        present, sure, but it seems to only have a portion of a functioning
        consciousness. At this point the mollusk admits to itself that it can
        get no further with the device off. Before it can attempt to start up
        the machine, it feels motion. Its outpost is being moved. It is not in a
        state to escape, and so it trusts that this movement will lead to a
        safer location as it has no current idea where it is. The idea that, in
        fact, it is being dragged off to somewhere blatantly
        <b>un</b>safe gains weight in the mind mollusk's mind. It analyzes some
        options for dealing with this possiblity and stores them in a physical
        secretion, leaving the resulting orb off to the side. It is stored
        safely within the robot for now, along side the transmission.</em></p>
        <p><em>Once it feels that it stopped moving, the parasite begins
        analyzing its host once more. It connects to the terminals of the unit's
        power source and finds the source long dead; it has developed scale
        covering a caustic acid leak. It recoils slightly from the burning
        sensation the scale induces. Contacting the negative terminal with the
        corroded assembly it once was hardwired to causes the robot to jerk,
        throwing the mollusk against the outside wall. It can make use of
        this.</em></p>
        <p><em>It stretches out along the body, interfacing now with a ring of
        cameras mounted upon the head of the robot. Four eyes are mounted on the
        ring, clustered in pairs of two, but only one eye out of the four seems
        to activate when the mollusk, again, connects the negative terminal to
        the bus. The two clusters of eyes are meant to swivel around the ring,
        but at the moment they're nonfuction. Both of the clusters lay against
        the floor; gravity is the only force able to move them. The mollusk is
        lucky that the sole functioning eye is pointed up at the rest of the
        room. It adds the information it has gained on this unit's optical
        system to the orb dedicated to this unit's design. Through the
        functioning eye it spots a figure, dark against the light seeping in
        from what the mollusk assumes is a hallway. It seems as if there is
        something in front of the figure, perhaps a counter, but the image is
        already fading quick from the mollusk's working memory. Another jerk of
        the robot --- this jerk to power the eyes yet again --- reveals the
        figure's appearance: a rotund man, and the presence of a second
        figure behind a counter: a man best described as being more
        "rectangular", or perhaps just more firmly built. It continues to
        twitch, trying to reveal more about its surroundings. Machines surround
        it. Light is scarce. The two figures are communcating in a language it
        can't seem to decipher. The pearl dedicated to this interaction grows to
        the size of a small gravel.</em></p>

        other than Indigo itself, or even why this this broadcast was requested,

        <p>The commotion after Viridian's puppet disappeared was quite intense.
        Due to the intense emotional distress, the auxiliary subsystems ---
        any subsystem which are not Subsystem 1, name "Indigo", --- lost contact
        with the main subsystem. They also noted a temporary but severe
        brownout. In the resynchronization of the subsystems subsequent to the
        disconnect, it was revealed that Indigo was using almost all of her
        computational capacity, the cause of the dramatic spike in power
        utilization by Subsystem 1, to compute how to comfort Viridian. About
        8820 thoughts were transmitted between Indigo and Viridian within the
        few tenths of a second that the auxiliary subsystems lost contact with
        Indigo.</p>
        <p>While this was happening, the 7 rationality processors (subsystems
        2-8) had noted the ALFO Low Wave Detection Array's sudden spike in
        activity and deduced that the puppet had most likely traveled across the
        plane<sup>6</sup>. This deduction lead to a flurry of activity at ALFO.
        The result is pronounced in great detail in <a href="./index.html">this
        document</a>.</p>
        <p>Workers were alarmed by the power spike (about a 5 times increase in
        power going towards Indigo's tower ("Ascension") and about a 7 times
        increase in power going to Viridian's tower ("The First Decent")), but
        the main capacitor array was able to deal with the load handily. By the
        time workers had been notified of what happened the event had already
        concluded. The first instruction from Indigo: Create a new puppet for
        Viridian.</p>

            <em>He decides this is a good moment to test the join mobility of
            this unit anyhow, though touching the cold metal body is shockingly
            scary. He decides to pause and wash up and put on some gloves. He
            comes back to the device but doesn't find it any easier to touch.
            His breath slowly quickens as he rotates the head, though all the
            adrenaline was for nothing as all it does is emit a loud grinding
            sound. He sighs, notes this down, and tries the other joints. They
            all are jammed and take considerable force to open.</em>

            "I'm gonna have to do some surgery, aren't I..." <em>He remarks this
            in  an annoyed tone, but he knows that this will be exciting. He
            grabs a drill and some screw bits. He's hoping that he won't have to
            drill through and destroy the screws, but he's not hopeful. What
            luck does he find himself in, then, that a standard three pointed
            star opens the casing.</em>

            <em>He leans forwards and then quickly recoils, almost knocking
            himself over. A pulsating black mass is wrapped around the heart of
            this thing, and doesn't seem to like being exposed to the cold air
            of the repair room. At once it drops to the bottom of the robot's
            chassis, leaving Jonas just enough time peak back inside before
            there is a notification at the front door. He desperately tries to
            put the front casing back, on before realizing he doesn't have
            time. He rushes to the front door.</em>

        <h2 class="home-video">Sipho</h2>
        <p>Found: (Currently) Defunct West Recharge Bay</p>
        <p>External observations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In a state of extreme disrepair</li>
            <li>Color: White, covered in dust</li>
            <li>A marking on the chest is in an alien script - almost looks like
            it could spell out "Sipho" in some strange font. (Maybe an
            identifier? Though that could just be my biases towards things I
            recognize...)</li>
            <li>Limbs are long in proportion to it's body and each limb has 3
            points of rotation. One at the top of the limb, one in the middle,
            and one before a hand like section. Almost like a shoulder, elbow,
            and wrist. They're sharp and angular.</li>
            <li>Weird gloopy sound coming from inside main chassis. (I'd like to
            stall opening it for as long as I can...)</li>
            <li>Head has a ring of 4 cameras, clustered into groups of 2. Each
            eye looks as if it can rotate freely in it's socket.</li>
            <li>Upon moving the eyes, it seems as if one of the clusters is
            completely disconnected, the wires worn away. On the other cluster,
            one of the eyes is smashed, but the other is in alright condition
            for how old it seems.</li>
            <li>The joints are stiff and feel like they haven't been lubricated
            in years. (They probably haven't...)</li>
            <li>It's head looks enough like a person, but it feels very alien,
            almost insectoid. It's unsettling...</li>
            <li>It was spasming before I came near, but has stopped. (Knows I'm
            here?)</li>
            <li>It's "face" is marked with an asymmetric pattern. It almost
            looks like a data matrix or something like that. Maybe it was used
            for identification?</li>
            <li>Other than eyes, it doesn't have any other facial features. No
            mouth, no nose, no ears. (It doesn't seem to have proper ears, but
            there does seem to be multiple small holes around the head. They're
            radially symmetric, making me think they're a feature and not a
            symptom of decay. Possibly microphones?)</li>
            <li>The eye ring about two thirds of the way up from the base of the
            head.</li>
            <li>There's a hole on the side of its neck. It looks large enough
            that I could stick a finger through, not that I would... I don't
            want to know what kind of alien disease lurks in that thing. (I
            really am hoping that there isn't an infectious disease in here. I
            wonder if it was disinfected at all before it was brought to me...
            Probably not.) </li>
            <li>It has four articulated fingers on each hand, with a small nub
            at the wrist.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Side notes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The more I look at it the more alien the design is. It's marked
            up like a servent drone, but is too big to be one. It looks like it
            could possibly be concious, but it's missing a way of speaking. It
            looks like </li>
