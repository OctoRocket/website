            "So... I do have to ask you... where'd you find this piece of
            junk?" <em>A portly man sits at the front counter of a dimly lit
            repair bay. He chuckles to himself gently. He seems advanced in
            age.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well, it seems like this unit just... gave up. Either that or
            there was something very wrong it's interface because it was
            just in the middle of the charging bay that's currently being
            rebuilt, the one the west side. Quite an eerie sight really..." <em>
            A nervous looking man stands across the counter. He is wearing a
            reflective orange vest with a patch labeling him as an
            "NCRS<sup>1</sup> Worker."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The portly man shifts his glasses. A name tag reads "Jonas
            Bierfelt."</em> "Do you think..?" <em>He looks nervously at the
            worker. The worker gives a reassuring reply.</em> "No. It was an
            GA<sup>2</sup> who reported spotting it. I'd hope they'd check if it
            was Cavaric<sup>3</sup>, but who knows... I'd expect another GA at
            your door soon anyhows. It doesn't look like any model of anything
            --- sapient or otherwise mind you --- I've seen working on
            this station." <em>The worker takes a second, thinking.</em> "And
            from working over at Evanesce..." <em>He continues, stalling for
            time as he lets his brain work.</em> "No, I don't think I've seen
            anything like this at all."
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>He peers back into the repair bay; his eyelids squeeze as
            they try to make out the figure laying uncomfortably on the floor.
            His face strains as he's taken aback by its twitching.</em> "I'm not
            sure why... but don't you feel like there's something wrong with it?
            It's like seeing a rabid<sup>4</sup> animal... so helpless lying
            there on the floor..." <em>The man's face is full of pity, something
            that causes the repair worker to swivel his chair to face the unit.
            His face doesn't match that of the worker.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            "Well yeah something's wrong with it, there's something wrong with
            everything you bring in," <em>he remarks in a lighthearted tone. His
            eyes study the twitching figure for a moment more.</em> "But I do
            agree, something is definitely different about it... Maybe it's just
            the missing model information that has me..." <em>He knows this not
            to be the case, there's something deeper, more primal at the heart
            of his concerns. It's a feeling almost maternal.</em> "I'll see what
            I can do." <em>He speaks now in a reserved tone, though he's halfway
            to getting off his chair when he remembers he must address his
            client. He turns slowly.</em> "I'd figure it's some sort of rehashed
            product." <em>He says, despite not recognising any element of the
            design. He continues,</em> "made as a quick cash grab by a company
            that went out of business a month after making it." <em>A soft hum
            of a fan system starts up, then sputters to a stop. It's interposed
            by a beep. Neither of the men notice.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>The worker nods, finally looking away from the spasming device.
            </em> "As always," <em>he remarks, trying to lighten the tone,</em>
            "I hope I don't have to see you again, but by now you know that I'll
            be around the tavern for drinks. Hope I haven't bothered you too
            much this thursday<sup>5</sup>!" <em>He chuckles slightly, but can't
            shake the unnerving feeling of the clinking in the darkened bay.
            </em> "Ah, well you've certainly given me some work. I might be a
            bit late to the tavern. This thing's just too intriguing to me..."
            <em>He thinks for a moment, accidentally allowing the worker to stew in
            his nerves a bit longer.</em> "Ah, sorry, see you soon yeah?" <em>
            The worker nods.</em> "Sure thing, see ya Jonas." <em>Jonas does not
            return the farewell as the worker walks off, possibly content with
            his goodbye already, but more possibly interested more in the alien
            object now in his possession more than the tavern or the worker.

            well known. The war played out more like a game; raids, shootings,
            and bombings were carried out but no casualties occured. A study
            from the time took survey of the soldiers after the war had

            on an injury that left permanent damage."</li>
