No use looking out¬
It's within that brings that lonely feeling¬
Understand that when you leave here¬
You'll be clear among the better men¬
Alone again¬

I am alone, aren't I? (I hope not)[I hope so...]¬
Being alone is dangerous[, but at least not as dangerous as being with the rest¬
of them](. I know I can't come back, and I know if I did I wouldn't even be¬
myself, but man do I wish I could be somewhere familiar... or at least¬
somewhere that feels familiar. Where is back? Why would it feel familiar)¬
