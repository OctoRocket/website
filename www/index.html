Anyways so Hai! If you're looking at this code you're probably trying to make your own website, or at least have a
little bit of webdev desire. I'd recommend making one, it's really fun! Don't say about dumb things like "ohh but I
don't know how to code! I'm not smart enough to do that!" because it's not true. You, YOU, can do anything you want, if
you just try. I know it can be hard, but take this as inspiration. Do it. Make a website. I give you full permission to
steal from my website if you need something but don't know how to do something! That's the great part of making your own
website, you can just take stuff from other websites! Go forth and type some letters!!

                        His website is the reason that I decided to make this website in the reason I decided to make
                        this
                        website in the first place! If you're reading this, thanks for the inspiration!

                        You carefully align your ship next to the satellite. Without a word from the satellite, it
                        deploys a
                        blindingly thick swarm of nanodrones which immediately surround your ship. You hear your ship's
                        hull
                        groan as it is forcefully welded to the satellite. Your hear a hole being bored into the side of
                        your
                        ship. Before you can turn your head to look at the damage, air from the satellite is already
                        rushing
                        in. It looks homely... someone used to live here. You hear... footsteps? Maybe someone still
                        does...

                        Now, how about I (almost) properly introduce myself! I'm Asta, a |-| year old &gt;=|=&lt; who
                        enjoys programming, video gaming (of most genres!), listening to music (of just as many genres)
                        (when I remember to), ruining my computer in various ways, and talking to people! I suppose I
                        also like using way too many parentheses, and <a href="./untitled-1/index.html"></a>this writing
                        thing</a> is pretty cool too!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm a large proponent of free (libre) and open source software. I use Linux (NixOS) as my
                        operating system of choice and love this OS to death (probably unhealthily at this point). I
                        both feel self conscious about seeming to know a lot about computers and also like to brag about
                        it. I measure the amount I know by looking at the amount I don't know, which happens to be a
                        lot. Maybe that isn't the best idea when it comes to self esteem. /shrug
